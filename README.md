# Sentiment-Classification-using-machine-learning-algorithms

PS: Ugh, I didn't expect that this file would be such a mess..... :((( Anyway, the only python file is classification.py, and others are data files.

###### Here I use BOW(bag of words) and CHi-square for feature transformation, and use NB(Naive Bayes), SVM and KNN for classification. 

##### To run this code, you need:
###### python 2
###### Sklearn
